description: Create production-ready website-automation CLI packages in TypeScript for Deno, including a CLI plus companion client library, for repeatable website workflows such as scraping, form submission, downloads, login/bootstrap flows, session reuse, stable JSON output, and optional `deno compile` packaging. Use when the Agent needs to turn a website task into a reusable tool.

# Clifier

Generate a reusable website-automation package, not a one-off script. Default to
a Deno CLI plus a runtime-neutral client library. Keep the result concise,
polished, and JSR-ready.

Bias toward small, sharp, readable software: production-ready, highly usable,
and free of wasted motion.

Use references progressively. Read only what the current step needs:

- command surface:
  [references/cli-command-patterns.md](references/cli-command-patterns.md)
- site investigation:
  [references/investigation-workflow.md](references/investigation-workflow.md)
- runtime choice:
  [references/fetch-vs-playwright.md](references/fetch-vs-playwright.md)
- auth/session reuse:
  [references/auth-and-session.md](references/auth-and-session.md)
- docs/output: [references/output-and-docs.md](references/output-and-docs.md)
- JSR packaging: [references/jsr-publishing.md](references/jsr-publishing.md)

## Workflow

1. Define the CLI first.
2. Investigate the site with `playwright-cli`.
3. Prove or disprove `fetch`.
4. Decide on `fetch`, hybrid, or Playwright runtime.
5. Generate from `assets/templates/deno-cli/`.
6. Validate the happy path and publishability.

## Define The CLI

Read [references/cli-command-patterns.md](references/cli-command-patterns.md)
before naming commands.

- Prefer product nouns, then verbs.
- Use direct top-level verbs only for cross-cutting commands such as `login`.
- Prefer `@cliffy/command` for Deno CLIs.
- Keep the CLI thin: parse flags, call library code, format output, and handle
  Deno-specific filesystem or session work.
- Keep the surface small, predictable, and guessable from the product
  vocabulary.
- Make the happy path obvious from `--help`.
- Map meaningful UI controls to flags before finalizing commands.
- Keep operational commands non-interactive after auth/bootstrap.
- Emit stable IDs from create-style commands and accept them directly in
  follow-up commands.
- Keep only commands that deliver real value. Do not keep `doctor`, `login`, or
  other template-era commands unless the real tool needs them.

## Investigate

Read
[references/investigation-workflow.md](references/investigation-workflow.md)
before implementing.

- Use `playwright-cli` for discovery, not as a runtime dependency of the
  generated package.
- Default to Chromium unless the user or site requires another browser.
- Reproduce one real happy-path run.
- Capture only the requests, identifiers, auth inputs, downloads, and UI
  controls that matter.
- Ask the user for manual login, MFA, sample inputs, or copied cookies or
  headers when needed.
- Clean up temporary investigation artifacts unless they are intentionally
  reused by the generated tool.

## Choose Runtime

Read [references/fetch-vs-playwright.md](references/fetch-vs-playwright.md)
before deciding.

- Prefer `fetch`.
- Use hybrid only when Playwright is needed for login or bootstrap and the saved
  state can be translated into the exact runtime cookies, headers, tokens, CSRF
  values, or other inputs that `fetch` needs.
- Use Playwright runtime only after a serious failed attempt to make `fetch` or
  hybrid work.
- Explain briefly what was investigated, how auth works at runtime, and why the
  chosen runtime is the simplest robust option.
- Validate at least one authenticated `fetch` request before calling a hybrid
  design production-ready.

## Handle Auth

Read [references/auth-and-session.md](references/auth-and-session.md) when auth
is required.

- Prefer explicit flags and environment variables.
- Do not add a general config file by default.
- For browser-login flows, prefer `login --session-path <path>` and require the
  same path on later authenticated commands.
- Never assume Playwright storage state is sufficient for plain `fetch`; prove
  how runtime auth is constructed.
- Keep secrets out of normal output, `--json` output, and repo files.

## Generate The Tool

Start from `assets/templates/deno-cli/`.

- Prefer the simplest clear implementation.
- Keep the package root for the library and export the CLI from `./cli`.
- Keep `mod.ts` as the public library root and `cli.ts` as the Deno CLI
  entrypoint.
- Keep code compact and readable.
- Prefer expressive names and straightforward structure.
- Keep runtime-neutral client code under `lib/`.
- Keep compiled binaries under `bin/` when the package includes a `deno compile`
  task.
- Include `name`, `version`, `exports`, and `deno publish --dry-run` validation.
- Avoid indirection unless it earns its keep.
- Make the intent obvious from names, control flow, and file layout.
- Prefer code that is easy to scan over clever or aggressively compressed code.
- Favor direct solutions over ceremony, helper churn, or architecture that only
  serves the template.
- Detect missing mandatory runtime dependencies and print exact install
  instructions when a command needs them.
- Remove template placeholder text, example commands, and unused support files
  from the final generated package.
- Remove scaffolding layers that do not improve usability.

## Finish

Read [references/output-and-docs.md](references/output-and-docs.md) while
polishing the result.

- Deliver concise human output, stable JSON, useful errors, and clear next-step
  affordances.
- Include a root `README.md` and a root `COMMANDS.md`.
- Keep command names, help text, docs, and examples aligned.
- When the tool depends on Playwright browsers or other non-bundled runtime
  dependencies, validate the missing-dependency path too.
- Validate `--help`, `deno task check`, the happy path, and
  `deno publish --dry-run`.
- Validate a real invocation path users will actually use, not only local task
  wrappers.
